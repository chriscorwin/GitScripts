This project attempts to make your life easier.

The basic components are:

bash_profile_config - This file holds all aliases and bash customizations
environment_config.default - This file holds all default paths for different workspaces/programs/directories
environment_config.overrides - This file is the one you should change if something in environment_config.default needs changed

These three files are "cat"ed together to become your "bash_profile" file.


The rest of the files in this project are little programs that were written to make it easier to use git and to automate certain tasks.

A basic run-down of the most commonly used tasks is listed in aliases.txt
