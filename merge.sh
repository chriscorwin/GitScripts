#	@usage merge [<branch_name> [into <branch_name2>]]
#
#	@description
#	This script is a helpful wrapper for merging one branch into another.
#
#	If you have merge conflicts and you want to resolve them, running this command will get that
#	started as long as you have your mergetool configured [TODO: Add documentation or link to
#	documentation. For now, here is a link that I have not read the contents of, but this might
#	get you started: http://www.davesquared.net/2009/02/setting-up-diff-and-merge-tools-for-git.html]
#
#	If you are trying to initiate a merge of two branches, this script will do that too. The command
#	is more intuitive (than "git merge") because it uses "into" to clearly distinguish merge direction.
#
#	There are some helpful safeties included as well. Referenced branches
#	are checked for existence before the script gets too far along, protected branches are checked,
#	and merge conflicts are determined after the merge. If merge conflicts should arise, the
#	user is prompted to resolve them using the native git mergetool.
#	description@
#
#	@notes
#	- If specifying both branches in the merge, the second parameter (which should be "into") is
#	not explicitly checked. Technically, a user could successfully merge two branches with the
#	command "merge branch1 flapjack branch2".
#	notes@
#
#	@examples
#	1) merge                            # Runs your pre-configured merge tool
#	2) merge master                     # Merges master into current branch
#	3) merge my-branch into master      # Merges my-branch into master (unless master is a protected branch)
#	4) merge my-branch another-branch   # This will fail. The second "action" parameter (into) must be included.
