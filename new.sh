#	@usage new <branch_name> [from <existing_branch>]
#
#	@description
#	This script provides several ways to create a new branch. You will be able to create a branch
#	based off of:
#		1. Specified <existing_branch>
#		2. The current branch you are on
#		3. The master branch
#
#	In addition, the branches will automatically be tracked and pushed up to any remotes you have
#	configured. Don't worry, you will get the option to choose which remote you want the branch
#	pushed to if you have configured more than one.
#	description@
#
#	@notes
#	- You will end on the new branch. That is, it will be the currently checked out branch.
#	- The stash and reset options in the initial menu currently only work when your
#	  starting branch is the master branch.
#	notes@
#
#	@examples
#	1) new some-work
#	2) new some-work from old-work
